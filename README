Welcome to Livermore fetch. 

The goal of this program is to fetch and process data from the yahoo finance api, to be used late for AI training purposes. This program have four major components, listed below:

1: Fetch all symbols used in the yahoo api [x]
2: Fetch all the daily stock information for the last 10 years []
3: Integrate this with [polars](https://www.pola.rs/) to account for after market trades []
4: Add a dockerfile to make this able to be executed monthly on servers headlessly []

Future additions will also include github actions amongst other addition.

If you have any contribution feel free to add them I am more than inclined to make this work.


My goal is to have these four major parts completed before the begining of summer as I want to build an AI as my usmmer project.
